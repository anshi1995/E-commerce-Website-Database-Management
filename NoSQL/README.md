A small part of the database model that we have created has been implemented in the Neo4j application as part of NoSQL implementation. This is a graph database that helps to easily visualize the relationship between different tables. Out of the 13 tables, we have implemented 5 important tables including Customer, Orders, Product, Category and Supplier. Cypher queries have been written to create these tables. Further, the relationships between these tables have been defined.
