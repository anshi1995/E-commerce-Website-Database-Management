# E-commerce-Website-Database-Management
In recent times, online retail platforms have gained popularity over traditional stores as the shopping behaviors are changing.
The main objective of this project is to develop an e-commerce platform model for a customer where they can register or buy a product i.e., it allows registered users to view and purchase the required products.
For the project, I have chosen to build the online shopping model for electronics including mobile phones, laptops, monitors, phone accessories, speakers etc.

## Database Description:
1)	Any user can register on the website and view the available products. Only registered users can purchase the products available. The **login** user will need to input information such as name, email address, date of birth, phone number, etc.
2)	When a customer makes the first purchase, new information related to the **payment** such as billing address, shipping address, card and/or bank details etc., will be added to the database.
3)	Each customer can place several **orders** at a single time. The customer can add multiple products (at least one) to a **shopping cart**.
4)	Each order will generate an **order items** entry which will hold the information of all the products that have been bought in each order being placed. 
5)	Each product can be sold by several **suppliers**. One supplier can be linked to multiple products. The user can choose the supplierâ€™s name while making a purchase.
6)	The **products** sold on the website will contain information such as item number, name, category, availability  in stock or not, customer rating, etc.
7)	Each product will belong to a certain **category** depending on the type of item being sold. One product can belong to a single category.
8)	Each order can be assigned to a **courier** service that takes care of shipping the products to the customer.
9)	3 types of roles (supplier, customer, and admins) with different privileges granted will be available on the website.
* **Suppliers** are the source of the range of products available.
*	Once the visitor decides to purchase items, they need to register on the website. Such users then become **customers**.
* **Admins**, on the other hand, will have special privileges apart from the other roles. This will include adding new products, editing, or removing available products, marking products as out of stock, etc.
